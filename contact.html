        <h1>Bonjour Ami!</h1>
        <h2>We are <span id="game-title-span">Un Petit Jeu Francais</span>!</h2>
        <h3>Here's a little bit about us..</h3>

        <p>We are a small team of language lovers in the beautiful eccentric city of Paris</p>

        <p>We created this little game for you to either a) learn French or b) practice your ongoing level in French</p>
        
        <p>We believe the best way to learn a language is to practice little and often - we'd love you to see our game as a way to do that</p>

        <p>Don't take it too seriously!  It is supposed to be fun.</p>

        <p>Try to play a few times per week.. before long you will notice your mistakes decreasing, score and difficulty level increasing..</p>

        <!-- info about the game -->
