# UX  

## Website owner goals

The website owner's goals are to present quick, fun, dynamic French test for users to practice their vocabulary and receive feedback on their level in French.  There is enough game content for the quiz to not be repetitive.  It is designed to be easily accessible, requiring no sign-up, form or email input to play. 

## User goals

### New user goals:

* to determine if they can remember any French they learned in school
* to discover what their level in French is
* to have fun while improving their language skills

### Returning user goals

* to determine if their level in French has improved since last time
* to determine if they can beat their previous score
* to continue to practice their language skills

## User stories

### As a business owner:

* I would like to present a short quiz to those interested in learning the French language
* I would like users to be able to easily play the game without having to load a separate system or sign up to the website
* I would like users to feel like they can return periodically to improve their language skills
* I would like users to know where to find suitable learning material

### As a new customer:

* I would like to find a website which is basic, easy to load, intuitive and enjoyable to use
* I would like to be able to choose different difficulty options and lengths of the game
* I would like to know which answers I got right and wrong

### As a returning customer:

* I would like to be able to use the quiz once a week to maintain my level in French


## Structure of the website

The structure of the website is straightforward and intuitive.  There are three main pages: one which is the main game area, the second which is a library of language learning resources, and lastly a basic contact page. 

In the main game area, as the user navigates through the game the screens change - for example to choose game options, the actual quiz area, and feedback pages. 

The website is designed to be responsive on all devices; viewing the website on different screen sizes should not affect the user experience.  

## Wireframes

[Wireframes](https://wireframe.cc/) was used to visualise website ideas and maintain an idea of layout and styling.  See all pages concepts below.

### End Game Design

## Surface

### Fonts

The website largely uses IBM Plex Sans, with the main front page header in a custom French-looking font called Peignot, and sans-serif as a back-up font. 

### Colours

The colour scheme is kept to blacks and whites during the actual game, in order to be non-distracting to the user.  There is a pleasant background image of Paris.

The front page of the website is designed to look like a French road/street sign, with further emphasis on the French look with red, white and blue colors to replicate the French flag.

### Images

The only image used in the website is the background image of Paris, and is credited in the [Credits section](#credits).

# Features

The website has the following features:

## Intro and Outro
### Intro Screen Page
![Intro-Screen](assets/images/RM-Front-Page.JPG)
The game intro screen is designed to replicate a French street sign.  There are several types of font, with the main font in large red type as it is the title of the game.  The fonts were chosen to be "French-y", like one might find on a French sign or wine box.

There is a loose translation of the game title - Un Petit Jeu Francais/A Little French Quiz - beneath the red font, to not exclude users who are entirely new to the language. 

There is only one way forwards with this page, as demonstrated by one single button at the bottom of the page encouraging the user to click o and play the quiz. 

## Game Options

## Game Area Page

### Sections
The game area is split into two sections; on the left, the questions and multiple choice answers and buttons.  This is an active area which with the user can interact.

The right area of this section is informative only, displaying the game progress and score tallies.

### Question 
![Question](assets/images/Question.JPG)
The question is displayed at the top of the left area, with the 'question word' in orange for emphasis, and a emphatic gap between this word and the others in the sentence to further draw attention to the word.  The font is always large and clear.

### Multiple Choice
![Footer](assets/images/readmeFooter.JPG)
The footer displays all important top level information about the gym.  It largely consists of contact information.

Furthest to the left, similar to the navigation bar, sits the Dunkeld Fitness Center and logo, which can hyperlink back to the Homepage when clicked.  

The footer is responsive to different screen sizes.  In particular, for pages which only need to take up 1 screen height - Homepage, About Us - the footer is fixed and always in view.  For pages with more content - Facilities, Membership, Classes - the footer sits at the bottom.  When the screen width is decreased, the footer format changes to a list style as opposed to four columns of information, which results in the footer being much taller than at bigger screen sizes.  To avoid the footer filling almost the entire screen and smaller screen sizes, the footer stops being fixed and always viewable, and sits at the very bottom of the page.

Lastly, the footer background colour changes with each page, to match the colour theme of the page and is thus more pleasing to the user. 

### Progress and Tallies
![Homepage](assets/images/readmeHomepage.JPG)

There is a high resolution background image from Pexels on each page.  The navigation bar, footer, and content sit in front of this picture. The colour scheme is always natural and attractive, as opposed to loud and gaudy.

### Buttons
There are three buttons on this page, to allow the user to either move onto the next question, or skip the question (not allowed in 'Hard' game play), or return home. 

### Warning Messages

## Feedback

## Homepage

### Incentives List
The incentive list (see above picture) on the front page draws attention to four main points which separate this gym from others.   The list is dynamic, with check-marks appearing next to each bullet point in a short animation to enhance user experience. 

## Facilities

### Information Boxes

![Facilities Info](assets/images/readmeFacilities.jpg)

These five information boxes detail specifically what you should expect to have use of when you join the gym. The styling is very basic, with white background and black text, to contrast the busy background image.

## Classes

## Timetable

![Timetable](assets/images/readmeTimetable.jpg)

The timetable on the Classes page is basic and kept to only 4 columns.  It clearly displays which days and times classes run, how long the classes are, the activity itself and how many people the user will be in the class with.  

Importantly, users need to know how to book themselves onto the classes, so the top header on this page explains that the only way to book is over the phone.  The footer on this page is kept fixed on the bottom of the screen to keep the phone number in plain site for the user, so they are not required to navigate to another page to find the number. 

### Gallery

![Classes Gallery](assets/images/readmeGallery.jpg)

The gallery is an attractive feature to display what the classes run at the gym are like, and to give the user an idea of what to expect if they joined one. It is a masonry layout to give flexibility to additional images as they are added, and creates an interesting user experience.

## Membership

### Contract and Pricing Info

There is another list of incentives to join this gym and pricing info. 

### Form

![Form](assets/images/readmeForm.jpg)

The second part of the membership page is a membership form, with a plain grey background to match the colour scheme of the above background image.  This is the only page with two different backgrounds - as this is the only page with something the user has to *do* (fill in the form) as opposed to just *read*. 

The form styling is kept intuitive and short, with only basic personal information.  The process is also kept clear at the top of the form, as it clearly implies that if the user fills in the form, a member of the gym staff will get back to the user personally to get more info and confirm the membership. 

It is hoped this emphasises again that this gym stands out from other big, cheap, chain gyms which have an automatic sign up and accept anyone and everyone.  The extra step with a personal contact from gym staff implies to the user that they are an important client and all clients are considered individually. 

## About Us

![Contact](assets/images/readmeContact.jpg)

### Contact Information
This section reveals to the user all ways to get in contact with the gym - email, phone, and social media.  The social media icons increase in size with mouse hover, to emphasise that they are links, and they open in a separate browser.

### Map
The map gives the user a location without having to copy the address and open Google Maps separately.  

## Features Left to Implement

* Personal Training Page
* Information about classes
* FAQs
* Contact form

# Testing

## Functionality Testing

I used Chrome developer tools throughout the project for testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

## Validator Testing

### HTML Testing
The code was passed through the official HTML *W3C validator* with no errors returned. 

### CSS Testing
The code was passed through the official CSS *Jigsaw validator* with no errors returned. 

There were 4 warnings about background colour matching border color, but as this did not cause any major issues within the code, and was a deliberate styling, the issues were overlooked.

![CSS Warnings](assets/images/CSSWarning.jpg)

## Compatibility testing

The site was tested on all browser sizes during development, to ensure the website maintained a structured layout for all screen sizes.  

Finally the code was passed through [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to ensure all pages looked good on different sizes. 

## User stories testing  

### As a business owner:

* I would like to clearly exhibit what separates my gym from other gyms by showing off our professional and sophisticated gym space
    > There is a large high-resolution picture of one of the gym rooms on the Homepage, which gives a lasting first impression of the ambiance and vibe of the gym

* I would like to draw in new members by offering a competitive membership rate and attractive contract terms
    > The Homepage describes a low competitive contract rate, and the membership page reinstates this by listing the contract terms and specific pricing.  The user has to navigate to another page to find the specific price, taking in more information about the gym 

* I would like users to know exactly what facilities they will have access to if they visit the gym
    > The Facilities page clearly lists all gym spaces and equipment

* I would like users to feel like they can easily get in contact about any queries
    > There is contact information in the footer, which is displayed on each page, and there is a separate contact page which reiterates all this information

### As a new user:

* I would like to find out if this gym is a suitable location for me to attend everyday on my way home from work
    > The location of the gym is clear from the Homepage which names the town in the large centered title, there is a footer on each page which displays the address, and the About Us page displays this information as well as a Google Map of the gym location.

* I would like to find out what classes they have and how frequently they run
    > From the Classes page, I can clearly see that classes run 3 days per week, and that there is a choice of 4 classes.

* I would like to know how much it would cost for a membership and any terms related to my contract, and join the gym
    > On the Membership page, I can see there are only 2 options for a membership, and there is a list of contract terms. Beneath this is a basic form I can fill in to request a membership.

* I would like to know how to get in contact with the gym
    > There is contact information in the footer at the bottom of each page, as well as contact information in the About Us page. 

### As a returning user: 

* I would like to book onto one of the upcoming classes this week
    > When I'm on the Classes page, the footer which displays the telephone number is fixed in view. It clearly states at the top of the page that classes are to be booked over the phone.

* I want to get in contact about a problem with my membership
    > All contact information is clear in the footer and About Us page. 

* I want to find their social media links so I can join their Instagram stories
    > On the About Us page, there is a link to the gym's social media pages, which open in a separate tab.

## Limitations of Project

### Membership Form
The membership form does not do anything or lead to anywhere, aside from clearing itself of information after submission. 

### Social Media Links
The social media links simply link to the general site eg Facebook, as opposed to a specific page. 

### T&Cs
The terms and conditions link on the membership form does not link to a document.

## Unfixed Bugs

### Footer

The footer caused problems on some pages staying at the bottom of the page.  Some pages are only 1 screen size - for example Homepage and About Us.  Whereas the others have more content and therefore require scrolling.  In larger screen sizes it was desirable for the footer to remain fixed in position, but when reduced to smaller sizes and the footer changes to a taller column layout, it is preferred that the footer is hidden at the bottom and requires scrolling, so as not to take up the whole page.  

This idea in practice took some fiddling, and ultimately on a few pages, a fixed height "spacer" div was placed to keep the footer where it needed to be.  

### Gallery Layout

The gallery layout was adjusted for media queries, however since the position of images changed during browser resizing, there were gaps of varied heights revealing the white background of the gallery.  While in some screen sizes this could look tidier, it may add a sense of the 'social media' aspect of the gallery and imply that gaps are there because images are regularly uploaded to the site as they are taken.  Therefore this 'bug' is left unfixed. 

### CSS Warning

There were 4 CSS warnings, outlined in section [CSS Testing](#css-testing).
